Newt DB, the amphibious database
================================

- In Python: enjoy the ease of working with your data as ordinary
  objects in memory.

  Data are moved in and out of memory as needed, so databases can be
  as large as needed.

- In Postgres: index and search your data using PostgreSQL, from within your
  application and externally.

- Within your application, search results may be returned as
  application objects, or as data, depending on your needs.

- Transactional and built on mature technology for reliability.
