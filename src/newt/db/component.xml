    <key name="transform" datatype="dotted-name">
      <description>
        The dotted name of a function (or callable object) to
        transform generated JSON data.  This provides a way to control
        how your JSON data are generated and also provides a mechanism
        for ignoring some objects.

        The callable will be called with a class name and a state as a
        bytes string in JSON format.  It must return:

        - None to indicate that the original state should be used, or

        - A new state JSON bytes string.  An empty string may be
          returned to indicate that the record should be excluded from
          the database.

    <key name="auxiliary-tables" datatype="string-list">
      <description>
        One or more names of auxiliary data tables.

        These tables must have zoid as a primary key and it should be
        the only required field.  Records will be added or replaced in
        these tables after the newt table has been updated and they
        will generally use newt data to compute additional columns for
        indexing.
